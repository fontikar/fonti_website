## maintain this website

- Put things in `content/`
- Never move directories with `themes/`
- Put icons in .svg format in themes/../asset/icons

```{r cars}
blogdown::check_site() # is your friend
blogdown::build_site() # to render new posts
blogdown::serve_site() # to preview, do this once per session
```
