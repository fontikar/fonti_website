## Oh hello!

I am a postdoc at University of New South Wales where I work with researchers and develop R packages to facilitate their research. I also train others how to improve their coding skills and co-founded UNSWcodeRs - a R-user community across for students and staff. 

I am also a Data Analyst at [Atlas of Living Australia](). I work with the Science and Decision Support team and my role involves streamlining data cleaning workflows. 

Prior to all my coding adventures, I was a [Evolutionary Biologist]() and did my PhD and Masters on lizards! Oh how life has changed. I liked doing research but I found myself enjoying the coding and statistical parts a lot more so here I am!
