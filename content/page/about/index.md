### I am evolutionary biologist wearing R developer shoes. 

Half the time, I work at [Atlas of Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au/) as a Data Analyst in the Science and Decision Support Team. 

The other half of my time, I make R packages with researchers at [The University of New South Wales](https://www.unsw.edu.au/). 

My work interests include biostatistics, reproducible science, learning about the latest coding practices and teaching others to enjoy using R. 

Outside of work, I like baking, sharing my creations with friends and family, I freedive and practice yoga.
